But what if we cannot find a pre-trained model that does exactly what you need, and what if we do not have a sufficiently large dataset to train a model from scratch? In this case, there is a very helpful technique we can use called [transfer learning](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/02/07/what-is-transfer-learning/).\n",

    "With transfer learning, we take a pre-trained model and retrain it on a task that has some overlap with the original training task. A good analogy for this is an artist who is skilled in one medium, such as painting, who wants to learn to practice in another medium, such as charcoal drawing. We can imagine that the skills they learned while painting would be very valuable in learning how to draw with charcoal. \n",

    "Before we add our new layers onto the [pre-trained model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#pre-trained-model), we should take an important step: freezing the model's pre-trained layers. This means that when we train, we will not update the base layers from the pre-trained model. Instead we will only update the new layers that we add on the end for our new classification. We freeze the initial layers because we want to retain the learning achieved from training on the ImageNet dataset. If they were unfrozen at this stage, we would likely destroy this valuable information. There will be an option to unfreeze and train these layers later, in a process called fine-tuning.\n",

To do this we unfreeze the entire model, and train it again with a very small [learning rate](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#learning-rate). This will cause the base pre-trained layers to take very small steps and adjust slightly, improving the model by a small amount.  \n",

The untrained pooling and classification layers that we added to the model earlier were randomly initialized. This means they needed to be updated quite a lot to correctly classify the images. Through the process of [backpropagation](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#backpropagation), large initial updates in the last layers would have caused potentially large updates in the pre-trained layers as well. These updates would have destroyed those important pre-trained features. However, now that those final layers are trained and have converged, any updates to the model as a whole will be much smaller (especially with a very small learning rate) and will not destroy the features of the earlier layers.\n",
